      [Bruno Mars & Gucci Mane:]
    Fly, fly, fly
    It's Gucci (it's Gucci)
    Huh? Fly (woo)


    I drink 'til I'm drunk (Yeah), smoke 'til I'm high (Yeah)
    Castle on the hill (Well damn), wake up in the sky
    You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I ain't fly)
    I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly (I know)
    The ladies love luxury (Huh)
    That's why they all fuck with me (Woo)
    Out here with the moves (Moves) like I invented smooth
    You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I ain't fly)
    I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly

    [Gucci Mane:]
    Huh, huh, huh
    I stay fresh as hell, take a pic, I might as well, hell
    Drop the top and take a selfie, my car drives itself
    I got white girls blushin', homie, college girls rushin' on me (Woo)
    All my diamonds custom so they clutchin' and they touchin' on me
    Ooh, think it's vegetables
    Ooh, think it's edible
    Ooh, it's incredible
    Ooh, ooh, ooh
    I smell like Bond No. 9 now
    Section full of fine dimes
    Bitches starin' at me sayin', "Wow"
    Unforgettable (Woo), like Nat King Cole (Huh)
    Gucci Barry White, I'm singing to your ho (Well damn)
    A one man show (Whoa), a human bankroll (Whoa)
    She lost in the sauce 'cause Gucci got the glow (Huh)

    [Bruno Mars & Gucci Mane:]
    I drink 'til I'm drunk (Burr), smoke 'til I'm high (It's Gucci)
    Castle on the hill (Huh), wake up in the sky (Yeah)
    You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I ain't fly)
    I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly (I know)
    The ladies love luxury, that's why they all fuck with me
    Out here with the moves like I invented smooth
    You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I ain't fly)
    I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly (I know)

    Now watch me fly, fly
    Now watch me fly, fly
    You can't tell me I ain't fly
    You can't tell me I ain't fly
    I know I'm super fly, I know I'm super fly

    [Kodak Black:]
    Kodak, Kodak
    I'm so fly, don't need no flight attendant
    Big Cuban link, don't need no pendant
    I ain't never had no pot to piss in, yeah
    Now all my records trendin'
    Oh my, I came from stealing bikes to flying on a G5
    I don't know why I'm smokin' this cherry pie so much but this my life
    I'm on Adderall, I be smellin' Hi-Tech when I piss
    Like it's basketball, I drop fifty-pointer on my wrist
    It's Lil Kodak, take a pic
    I came home and dropped a hit
    All these diamonds got me sick, I'm actin' spoiled (Woo)
    Cutlass sittin' high (Yeah), I feel like I can fly (Yeah)
    So fresh to death, it's crazy, feel like I can die
    I done finally got my wings, they make me wanna sing (Glee)

    [Bruno Mars & Kodak Black:]
    I drink 'til I'm drunk ('Til I'm drunk), smoke 'til I'm high ('Til I'm high)
    Castle on the hill (Ayy), wake up in the sky
    You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I ain't fly, baby)
    I know I'm super fly (I know it), I know I'm super fly (I know it)
    The ladies love luxury (Right), that's why they all fuck with me (Ayy)
    Out here with the moves like I invented smooth (Yeah, yeah)
    You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I don't fly, baby)
    I know I'm super fly (I know it)
    I know I'm super fly (I know it)

    [Bruno Mars:]

    I know I'm super fly, I know I'm super fly...
