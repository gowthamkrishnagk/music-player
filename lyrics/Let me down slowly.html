      This night is cold in the kingdom
      I can feel you fade away
      From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
      Your steps keep me awake

      Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
      I once was a man with dignity and grace
      Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
      So please, please

      Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
      A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

      If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
      If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

      Let me down, down
      Let me down, down
      Let me down
      Let me down, down
      Let me down, down
      Let me down

      If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
      If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

      Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
      As I'm walking down the corridor
      And I know we haven't talked in a while
      So I'm looking for an open door

      Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
      I once was a man with dignity and grace
      Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
      So please, please

      Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
      A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

      If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
      If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

      Let me down, down
      Let me down, down
      Let me down
      Let me down, down
      Let me down, down
      Let me down

      If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
      If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

      And I can't stop myself from falling down
      And I can't stop myself from falling down
      And I can't stop myself from falling down
      And I can't stop myself from falling down

      Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
      A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

      If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
      If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

      Let me down, down
      Let me down, down
      Let me down
      Let me down, down
      Let me down, down
      Let me down

      If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
      If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

      If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
      If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
