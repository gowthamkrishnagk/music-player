      I love it when you call me Señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la
Yeah, no

Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la
Yeah

I love it when you call me Señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it

When you call me Señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say, "We're just friends."
But friends don't know the way you taste-la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time comin'
Don't you let me fall, oh

Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop

I love it when you call me Señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it

When you call me Señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

All along I'll be coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya
Call my name, I'll be comin' for ya (comin' for ya)
Comin' for ya (comin' for ya)

For ya, for ya (oh, she loves it when I call her), for ya
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya
